This is a fun Project done to show how genetic algorithms can be used to solve fun problems, such as an online game. QWOP is perfectly suited to be solved using a genetic algorithm because it allows for continuous updating and improvments. 
To run this program, you should just run the program as you would any python script and it will automatically open QWOP and pick up from when you last left off.
python Genetic_QWOP
If you want to restart your progress just delet the contents of the other file.
